1. Generate a random seed phrase for themselves.
2. Create multiple solana wallets (ETH wallets maybe?)
3. Let the user see their Solana balance.
4. Let the user see their USDC/other token balances.

Bonus

1. User can send SOL to someone else
2. User can swap their SOL for some other token (USDC)

Production-grade UI spec. No fluff.

## Design System (non-negotiable)

**Visual**

* Dark-first. Near-black background, high-contrast surfaces.
* One accent color only (electric cyan or acid green). No gradients everywhere.
* Sharp typography hierarchy. Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for addresses/amounts.
* Zero skeuomorphism. No fake cards, no glassmorphism.

**Principles**

* Asset clarity > decoration.
* One primary action per screen.
* Wallet ≠ casino. Calm, precise, surgical.

## Outcome

This UI communicates trust, control, and competence.
If it feels “fun,” it’s wrong.
If it feels boring but powerful, it’s correct.
